# UCEF Metamodel

A Web-based Graphical Modeling Environment (WebGME) metamodel for the Universal Cyber-Physical Systems Environment for Federation (UCEF).

WebGME (https://webgme.org/) is a collaborative environment for the design of domain specific modeling languages and the creation of domain models. This repository defines a WebGME metamodel for the design of High Level Architecture (HLA) federations, and includes a set of WebGME plugins that convert those models into executable Java code.

This repository is meant to be used in conjunction with the UCEF virtual machine available at https://github.com/usnistgov/ucef and cannot be compiled on its own.
